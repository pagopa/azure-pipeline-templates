# Maven Github Release template

Opinionated sequence of steps to mark a new release of a Maven project hosted on a Github repository. It does the following:

1. bump the version according to a given [SemVer](https://semver.org/) option (`major`, `minor`, `patch` or `buildNumber`)
1. tag the repository with the new version number
1. push changes and tags to the repository
1. creates a Github release from the release tag

Be sure that code is checked-out using `persistCredentials: true` in the `checkout` step. Also be aware that the template commits **every** change on the release branch, thus be sure you only edit file you intend to include in the commit.

The template does not make any assumption on any specific maven version nor dependency to be installed. Please perform setup **before** including the template.
