# Terraform plan

Run terraform init and terraform plan.
It's assumed that the repository contains in a bash script `terraform.sh` that acts as a helper to pass to the commands the tfvars config files per environment.

You can find an example of the script in the following repository: [terraform.sh](https://github.com/pagopa/cstar-infrastructure/blob/main/src/terraform.sh)

## Prerequisites

- template: templates/terraform-plan/template.yaml@terraform
