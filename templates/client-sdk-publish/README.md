# Autogenerated Client SDK Publish template

A collection of steps to generate the client SDK wiith models based on an OpenAPI spec. It does the following:

1. generate models and client code based on a give OpenAPI spec, using [@pagopa/openapi-codegen-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pagopa/openapi-codegen-ts)
1. generate package.json based on main package.json values (like name and version), using [@pagopa/openapi-codegen-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pagopa/openapi-codegen-ts)
1. publish the package to NPM

Be sure that this template is called **after** the main package.json has been updated.
